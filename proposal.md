# Front-End Portfolio Project 

### User Stories 


- As a user, when I visit the website I see a links to multiple pages so that I can navigate from one page to the other
- As a user I can click on an About link so that it will navigate to a new page where I see information about the developer and cryptocurrencies
- As a user, information about crypto is retrieved from an API so that I can see a random crypto on the landing page
- As a user, I can type in an input box and search for a specific currency based on the users preference, (e.g. bitcoin) so that a new stream of information(price today,symbol, highs and lows) will appear based on that theme.
- As a user, if I try to submit with no entry in the input box, I see a message on the screen telling me to enter a value to search so that I cannot submit without entering a value
